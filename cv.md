###### **English skills**

I do not practice English every day. The company in which I work provides courses for learning and maintaining English for all employees. Currently, the courses are taught by a native speaker. I have an intermediate level of English. I started learning English at school, then at university, but I didn’t have a lot of language practice. At the moment I try to read, watch, listen to everything in English, in order to improve vocabulary.
